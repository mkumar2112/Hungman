# >>>>> Rules of Hungman.
# First wrong answer: Draw and upside-down "L." This is the post the man hangs from.
# Second: Draw a small circle for the "head" underneath the horizontal line of the "L."
# Third: Draw a line down from the bottom of the head for the "body."
# Fourth: Draw one arm out from the middle of his body for the "arm."
# Fifth: Draw the other arm.
# Sixth: Draw one diagonal line from the bottom of the body for the first "leg."
# Seventh: Draw the other leg.
